<p>
I scarce believe my love to be so pure<br>
  As I had thought it was<br>
  Because it doth endure<br>
Vicissitude, and season, as the grass;<br>
Methinks I lied all winter, when I swore<br>
My love was infinite, if spring make' it more.<br>
</p>
<p>
But if medicine, love, which cures all sorrow<br>
With more, not only be no quintessence,<br>
But mixed of all stuffs paining soul or sense,<br>
And of the sun his working vigor borrow,<br>
Love's not so pure, and abstract, as they use<br>
To say, which have no mistress but their muse,<br>
But as all else, being elemented too,<br>
Love sometimes would contemplate, sometimes do.<br>
</p>
<p>
And yet no greater, but more eminent,<br>
  Love by the spring is grown;<br>
  As, in the firmament,<br>
Stars by the sun are not enlarged, but shown,<br>
Gentle love deeds, as blossoms on a bough,<br>
From love's awakened root do bud out now.<br>
</p>
<p>
If, as water stirred more circles be<br>
Produced by one, love such additions take,<br>
Those, like so many spheres, but one heaven make,<br>
For they are all concentric unto thee;<br>
And though each spring do add to love new heat,<br>
As princes do in time of action get<br>
New taxes, and remit them not in peace,<br>
No winter shall abate the spring's increase.<br>
</p>

<!This poem resonates to me the more I grow, and come to understand what love actually means and how it changes form throughout my life.>
<!I had not heard of this poem, until I searched it using ChatGPT. I found it using command line: love and lies.
